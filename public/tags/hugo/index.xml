      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently in the process of re-designing my portfolio website and wanted to use the Hugo framework as it is lightning fast to build, comes with a neat blogging feature and is low maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the re-design and moving framework is that the original site was just coded using html, css and js. I want to move the website over to a modern framework which is easier to maintain and apply some component based logic where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hugo&#34;&gt;Why Hugo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I document my development journey Hugo offers a wonderful opportunity for a fully fledged blog feature. Generating a new post is as easy as running &lt;code&gt;hugo new blog posts/title&lt;/code&gt; which then creates all the correct routing and with the layouts markdown can even handle things like tags, author, date created, pagination and order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
