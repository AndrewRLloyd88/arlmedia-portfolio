    content="I'm currently working as a freelance full-stack developer and am part of the Mintbean.io developer collective.

I love building things with people.

I made my journey into tech with a background in the film industry and freelance videography. Last year I completed an introductory course to frontend and a web development bootcamp with Lighthouse Labs.

My previous roles have been primarily client focused which has allowed me to become naturally adept at communicating with clients and teams alike.

I am always looking to connect for opportunities and find a way to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to your projects.">
